When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   First of all when sharing my repo with other people. And when using multiples 
   computers even if is myself just the one contributing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Most of the time I think I prefer when to commit but, when I'm the only one
	contributing to the repository, could be usefull to have the local updated 
	automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is like a clone but just within projects in GitHub. 
	Clones makes a copy of a remote repository in local or a local repository in 
	other local directory
	And branch just tags a commit and enables to advance in parallel from one point.
	
	You should use clone whenever the repository is local or you are making one 
	repo local. 
	Fork just within GitHub
	And Branch for separate different lines of development but maintaining the 
	reference to one point. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
